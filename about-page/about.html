        <span class="b span-font-styles">Hi!</span> I'm Aaron Cordova, the one
        who created this website, Rivacool! I love to make cool projects like
        this! It's so much fun. Using only 3 coding languages, HTML, CSS, and
        JS, I can make this! Creativity is the word to use in coding. I hope
        that you enjoy browsing the page!
